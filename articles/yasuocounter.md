# How to Counter Yasuo: Full Guide

Yasuo, the agile swordsman in League of Legends, can be a daunting opponent. However, with the right tactics and champion selection, you can tip the scales in your favor. In this article, we'll delve deeper into the top strategies to effectively counter Yasuo and emerge victorious on Summoner's Rift.

# 1) Excelling in the Laning Phase Against Yasuo


Laning against Yasuo presents a very difficult challenge, particularly for squishy mages. To navigate this precarious phase effectively, it's crucial to adopt a methodical approach. In this section, we will delve into advanced laning strategies tailored to different champion archetypes, whether you're a mage or a melee champion.

- For Squishy Mages: Farming and Trade Minimization
If you find yourself in the role of a mage, your primary objective during the laning phase should revolve around accumulating gold and experience while minimizing trade engagements. You'll want to capitalize on positional mistakes by poking Yasuo whenever the opportunity arises and auto-attacking when you have a slow push occurring. This can put Yasuo in a precarious position where responding to your aggression may potentially cost him his life due to the focus from your larger minion wave. In especially challenging matchups, don't hesitate to select Exhaust as one of your summoner spells. Exhaust can provide a critical defensive advantage when faced with Yasuo's aggressive plays. (Always try to break his shield with an auto attack before engaging in poking)
- For Melee Champions:
As a melee champion pitted against Yasuo, such as Kassadin, Katarina, or Sylas, your primary emphasis should be on maximizing your creep score (CS). Yasuo excels at trading with melee champions, so prioritize efficient last-hitting to scale into the late game. Expect Yasuo to aggressively contest your CS, as these matchups inherently favor him. Maintain patience and employ hit-and-run tactics, avoiding prolonged skirmishes whenever possible.
- Strategic Wave Control
A savvy strategy when laning against Yasuo involves establishing a slow push in your favor, as previously mentioned. By accumulating a larger minion wave, you diminish Yasuo's ability to engage in trades effectively. This wave management tactic not only fosters a safer laning environment for you but also complicates Yasuo's attempts to capitalize on his aggressive tendencies. Furthermore, if Yasuo decides to engage you without affording you the opportunity to escape, endeavor to remain close to your minions; they will focus on him. Minions become your allies in such situations. Additionally, when engaging in any type of pushing play, prioritize vision control on the map. The midlane experiences significant traffic, particularly in the early game, and conceding a kill due to a preventable mistake would be regrettable.


# 2) Mastering the Mid and Late Game Against Yasuo


As the game progresses, countering Yasuo necessitates a nuanced understanding of his strengths and vulnerabilities. In this section, we will explore advanced strategies for dealing with Yasuo during the mid and late game phases.

- Effective Resource Management
A pivotal aspect of facing Yasuo in the mid and late game revolves around resource management. Pay meticulous attention to the champions on Yasuo's team capable of knocking opponents airborne, as he synergizes exceptionally well with them. It’s very important to not allow your backine get airborne as he’ll be able to easily ultimate from very far, surprising everyone and potentially changing the whole dynamic of the fight.


- Exploiting Yasuo's Vulnerability
As a fragile poke mage, when the mid game and late game approach, teamfights become inevitable. Your primary strategy should involve capitalizing on Yasuo's weaknesses. Preserve your CC abilities for him and prevent him from reaching your backline (you), where he can wreak havoc on your AD carry and yourself. Exercise caution when Yasuo deploys his Wind Wall (W), as it serves as his primary defense against skill shots. However, whenever this ability is on cooldown, it presents the perfect opportunity for your team to initiate a decisive engagement that can swiftly eliminate Yasuo. As a recurring theme in many guides, patience remains a key factor in teamfights. Avoid forcing moves that may inadvertently benefit the enemy team. As a squishy champion, your primary goal is to maintain proper positioning to minimize risks.
-Punishing His Lack of Escape Tools
If you're playing a melee or tank champion, you should assume the role of the team's frontline in teamfights, taking the lead and determining the opportune moments to engage. While this responsibility can be high-pressure due to the chaotic nature of teamfights, the strategy is straightforward. When your teammates are in close proximity and you spot Yasuo committing positional errors, such as overextending or straying from his team, that's your signal to initiate. Yasuo's kit lacks reliable escape tools, rendering him vulnerable to well-coordinated assaults. Exploit this weakness by punishing his mispositioning. Additionally, remain vigilant in dodging his skillshots, particularly his Qs, to mitigate the damage he can inflict during skirmishes and teamfights.

# 3) Champions Effectively Countering Yasuo

Choosing the right champion, also known as 'counter-picking,' is a valuable asset for gaining an edge before the game even starts.

- Renekton (TOP/MID)
Renekton's combination of point-and-click CC, high burst damage, and mobility presents a multifaceted threat to Yasuo. Engaging Yasuo with Renekton can disrupt Yasuo's mobility and combo potential, making it challenging for Yasuo to land his crucial skill shots and rendering Wind Wall ineffective. When playing Renekton against Yasuo, prioritize managing your Rage bar effectively to capitalize on your enhanced abilities at opportune moments.
- Pantheon (TOP/MID)
Pantheon counters Yasuo effectively. His W provides reliable crowd control (CC) to disrupt Yasuo's mobility and set up combos. Pantheon's burst damage, amplified by his passive, pressures Yasuo in trades. He can poke safely with Q chipping away at Yasuo's health. Manage your passive to block basic attacks and use your stun strategically.
- Yone (MID/TOP)
Yone is a strong counter to Yasuo. His W deals consistent damage while sustaining him through Yasuo's assaults. Yone's E offers both escape and engagement options, making it hard for Yasuo to predict his moves. Yone's R can surprise Yasuo and sway teamfights. Timing abilities and choosing engagements wisely are crucial to dominate Yasuo.
- Tryndamere (TOP)
Tryndamere excels in extended duels, making him a Yasuo nuisance. His Q grants substantial sustain for outlasting Yasuo. W reduces Yasuo's attack damage, weakening all-ins. Tryndamere's R grants temporary invincibility, baiting Yasuo into overcommitting. Manage Fury to engage when maximized for better success against Yasuo.
- Also Yasuo's squishy nature makes him a prime target for champions specializing in burst damage. Capitalize on this vulnerability by opting for champions who can deliver rapid, concentrated damage. Yasuo comes with no real ways to escape a hard engage, making him very vulnerable to assassins. 

**In conclusion, countering Yasuo requires careful strategy and champion selection. This guide has covered laning strategies, mid to late-game tactics, and champion choices to give you the edge. Whether you're a squishy mage, a seasoned teamfighter, or considering champions like Renekton, Pantheon, Yone, Tryndamere, or assassins, you now have the tools to prevail against Yasuo. Best of luck on Summoner's Rift!**
