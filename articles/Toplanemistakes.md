# Top Lane Tactics: Avoiding Common Mistakes



Top lane in League of Legends is a challenging arena where champions clash in intense duels. To excel in this role, it's crucial to recognize common mistakes and learn from them. In this article, we'll delve into three key points that can help you navigate matchups effectively, getting leads, capitalizing on your leads and understanding phases of the game.

# 1) Patience and decision making. 

Assessing the match-up, we’re starting off with a very difficult aspect of League of Legends because they’re so many match-ups possible that it’s hard to know and understand everything.

- What I suggest is to rely on two points: “Logic” being the first one and “what the opponents want” the second one. For example if the enemy champion has the ability to counter your spells easily you should not engage in fights early because that’s what he’ll want. The opposite situation works as well, if you have a favorable match-up you have to assess correctly in what way your match-up is favorable and how to convert that advantage into a concrete lead. 


- The Importance of Patience (Level 1 Strategy)
Many top laners make the critical mistake of trying to contest the wave at level 1 in ranged matchups. This is a misguided approach that can lead to serious consequences. In various matchups you’ll have to concede the first wave to the opponent in order to not lose health and XP. Beware of trades as well, attempting to engage in early trades can result in being poked down, leaving you at a severe disadvantage during the critical levels 2 and 3.
Even if you manage to push the wave, your opponent can freeze it near their tower, creating an unpleasant situation for you throughout the game. Meaning he will not let you approach the wave and will create a very good opportunity for his jungler. So don’t be a coin flipper and remain patient. 


- Waiting for the Right Moment (Level 3 Power Spike)

So I told you what you shouldn’t be doing, here’s what you should do facing a difficult match-up. avoid touching the wave during level 1, allowing your opponent to push. This sets the stage for a favorable turn of events once you reach level 3. It’s usually a great time to start trading. Wait for a positional mistake and when you finally engage, your opponent will be next to your tower instead of theirs, giving them a long and perilous journey to escape. Plus if you make any kind of mistake during the trade you can always get back to safety under your close turret.
Before committing to an all-in at level 3, ensure that the playing field is level. This includes the levels(XP), health points (HP), and creep score (CS). This is why saving your HP during the early game is essential.

Engaging when you have an advantage in these aspects will significantly increase your chances of success and more importantly reduce mistakes, directly diminishing opponents opportunities.


# 2) Mastering Top Lane Wave Management

Wave management is a fundamental skill for top laners in League of Legends. It's not just about last-hitting minions; it's about understanding when to play defensively and when to seize the offensive. In this section, we'll explore the importance of wave management and how it can give you a significant advantage in the top lane.

- Defensive vs Offensive Play is a crucial aspect of top lane. Recognizing whether you should be on the defensive or offensive can be tricky but your wave position plays a central role in determining this:

When the enemy wave is pushing into your tower, you are in a defensive position. Their wave is stronger, and overextending can be risky. You'll be focused by a lot of minions and lose much more health.
Conversely, when your wave is pushing towards the enemy tower, it's time to go on the offensive. You have the wave advantage and can create opportunities. Especially when your opponent doesn’t realize that the wave is actually bouncing back towards himself and keeps looking to fight you.


-  Preventing the "Danger Zone". One of the main objectives of wave management is to ensure the wave never gets stuck in the "danger zone" near the enemy tower. To achieve this, you can employ the 3-wave push strategy.

Early game: 
Slow push the first wave. 
Slow push the second wave as well.
Crash the third wave into the enemy tower.
By following this pattern, you can reset the wave and maintain control over its position. If you’re not familiar with this concept it can be a bit underwhelming and difficult at first sight but when done correctly it’s a very powerful way to seize control.

- Decision-Making After the Crash: After crashing the wave into the enemy tower, it's crucial not to get greedy. You have three primary decisions to make:

Recall: Often the safest choice, allowing you to return to lane with an item advantage, even if it's a small one. This can give you the upper hand in trades. You’ll also not lose minions and XP as you’ll get back in time to clear the wave that bounced back the enemy tower. 

Ward: Ensuring vision in the river or jungle can prevent ganks and help your team. Vision control is a shared responsibility.

Plates: While tempting, taking turret plates can be risky for melee top laners, as it exposes you to ganks. Assess the situation carefully before deciding to take plates.

# 3) Macro decisions: Understanding what Playstyle to Adopt.
 
- Top lane champions come in various shapes and sizes, with distinct strengths and weaknesses. It's vital to adapt your playstyle accordingly:
If your champion excels in teamfights rather than split-pushing, consider pushing out and roaming or taking Teleport to impact other lanes.
For duelists or split-pushers, focus on controlling your side lane, applying pressure, and drawing enemies away from your team.

- Synergy with Your Jungler. It’s tempting to think that Top lane is isolated from the rest of the map, but it’s not; it's part of the larger field. Playing in tandem with your jungler is key:

Be ready to contest the Scuttle Crab when your jungler paths towards the top lane.
The top laner who arrives earlier can tip the balance in the 2v2 skirmish, granting priority and control. Top lane is very often ganked, especially in lower elo so make sure to always have clear vision on where the enemy jungler is. For example, 3:30 minutes is a common timing for enemy junglers to gank as they usually finish clearing by that time. 
It’s also very important to understand concepts such as “Strong Side - Weak Side”, but that will be the subject of another article. 

**To conclude, in the fiercely competitive realm of League of Legends top lane, avoiding common mistakes is the key to success. We've explored three vital aspects of gameplay: patience and decision-making, wave management, and understanding your playstyle. By implementing these strategies and learning from your errors, you can enhance your top lane prowess and climb the ranks.**
