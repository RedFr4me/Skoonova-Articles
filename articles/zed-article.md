# The Art of Countering Zed (as a Poke Champion).

Are you tired of facing Zed and feeling powerless as he dashes through your team, leaving destruction in his wake? This guide is your beacon of hope. In the world of League of Legends, understanding your opponent is half the battle. In this article, we'll delve into strategies for countering Zed with three unique champions: Xerath, Jinx, and Syndra.

## 1) Understanding Zed's Kit and Threats

Before we dive into the specifics of countering Zed with our chosen champions, let's take a moment to dissect Zed's kit and understand what makes him tick. Zed is a high-mobility assassin with a kit built for bursting down single targets. Here's what you need to be aware of:

- Razor Shuriken (Q): Zed's skill shot poke ability that deals damage in a line. It's his primary tool for harassing and farming from a distance.

- Shadow Slash (E): This ability deals damage in a small area around Zed and slows targets hit. It's often used to set up his combo or to slow down enemies during an escape.

- Living Shadow (W): Zed's shadow-dash ability allows him to quickly switch positions with his shadow. This is crucial for his mobility and evasive maneuvers.

- Death Mark (R): Zed's ultimate ability marks a target and, after a short delay, triggers additional damage based on the damage dealt during the mark duration. It's his primary assassination tool.

Now that we have a grasp of Zed's kit, let's move on to champion-specific strategies.

## 2) Navigating the Phases of the Game:

While this article primarily focuses on Xerath, the guidance provided can be applied to any poke champion. Xerath is renowned for his extraordinary range and poke capabilities. When confronting Zed, here's how Xerath can seize control of the situation:

- Early Game Advantage: It's a common scenario when playing a poke champion against an early-game assassin to forget the importance of consistent poking. The early game is a crucial phase where you encounter your opponent for the first time. As Xerath, this is your opportunity to establish dominance and assert yourself by denying Zed access to the minion wave. You must maintain continuous pressure on him while preserving your own health. 

- Mid Game Challenge: The mid-game phase is where things become tricky, and it's the point at which you could swiftly lose any advantage gained during the early game. It's essential to recognize that Zed's primary objective is to close the gap and engage as soon as you make a positioning mistake.

To counter this threat, leverage Xerath's superior range to continuously poke down Zed before he has a chance to engage. Make precise use of your skill shots, especially Arcanopulse (Q), to apply consistent pressure and dissuade Zed from committing to an engagement that could result in substantial damage.

While maintaining the pressure is crucial, it's equally important to avoid overcommitting or venturing too deep into the lane. This may mean sacrificing a few CS (creep score), but prioritizing your safety ensures that you remain alive and deny Zed the opportunity he seeks.

- Late Game - Position and Vision Control: Now that you passed early and mid game successfully your main goal will be to avoid getting close to Zed at all costs. Maintain proper positioning and make use of vision control to avoid flanks by Zed. Ward nearby bushes and use the terrain to your advantage, as Xerath excels at poking from behind cover. Don’t go deep in the enemy territory as you have poor mobility and Zed thrills in that field. 

During team fights, it's crucial to avoid being the frontline. While this may sound obvious, a common mistake occurs when players unlock their camera to check the trajectory of their (Q) ability. This simple action can inadvertently lead you to move forward without realizing it. Such a positioning mistake could create an opening for the enemy team to engage.

So stay behind - place control wards in key areas to deny Zed's vision, and set up skill shot opportunities from unexpected angles.

## 3) Adapting Itemization: A Range Poke Mage's Defense Against Zed

In the battle against Zed, as a ranged poke mage, itemization is your armor against his relentless onslaught. Zed's ability to swiftly close the gap and deliver devastating burst damage makes it imperative for you to adapt your item choices to survive his aggression. In this section, we'll explore how to bolster your defenses effectively.

- Core Defensive Item Choices

Zhonya's Hourglass: This item is a game-changer when facing Zed. Zhonya's allows you to negate Zed's Death Mark damage by activating the golden stasis effect. When Zed ults you, pop Zhonya's, and his ultimate's detonation will be fruitless, giving your team a golden opportunity to strike back.

Banshee's Veil: This item provides a magical shield that can block one of Zed's abilities. The added magic resist makes you less vulnerable to Zed's magic damage.

Rylai's Crystal Scepter: Rylai's adds utility by slowing down Zed and his shadows when hit by your abilities. This can make it harder for Zed to land skill shots and follow up on engages.

These items are situational, meaning they usually come after your primary items such as Liandry or Luden’s echo. 

- Adapting Your Summoner Spell

When confronted with a high-burst champion like Zed, it becomes intriguing to consider adapting your choice of Summoner spells. Options such as Exhaust, Barrier, or Heal may prove to be exceptionally strategic.

Remember that your item build should adapt to the circumstances of the game. Whether it's your performance, the team composition, or how well you're handling the Zed matchup, flexibility is key. Don't hesitate to experiment with different item paths to find what suits your playstyle and the match's dynamics best.

**Conclusion:**


With these insights, you're now well-equipped to face Zed, the Master of Shadows, with unwavering confidence. As you implement these strategies and hone your skills, you embark on a journey to master the art of countering Zed, one game at a time.
