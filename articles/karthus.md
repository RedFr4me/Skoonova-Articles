# Karthus ADC Guide: Rise to Victory 

Karthus ADC is no longer an unconventional choice; we all recognize the champion's strength as an AD carry. Riot Games attempted to weaken his ADC potential by reducing his (Q) damage in the early game and the mana bonus gained from minion kills. So, the question arises: Is Karthus still a viable ADC? You will soon discover that not only is he viable, but he is actually one of the best picks available, and I will elaborate on why in this article.


# 1) Punitive but Squishy:

Playing Karthus provides you with potent lane control, allowing you to farm efficiently, deliver punishing pokes, and capitalize on every positioning error with your (Q) ability. However, you must also master positioning and respect the enemy team, especially when they attempt to place you in precarious situations. Let's delve into how adept Karthus players navigate the laning phase:

- Your (Q) boasts considerable range and deals significant damage when cast on an isolated target. The opportune moment to unleash your (Q) is when the enemy ADC goes for a last-hit. Perfect timing is essential, avoiding a premature cast that allows the enemy to sidestep and a delayed one that lets them hit the minion and evade your (Q) before it fully activates.

- Consistently poking the enemy ADC serves a crucial purpose: Karthus is exceptionally fragile and lacks escape options. Consequently, steering clear of aggressive engagements is paramount. Moreover, this constant harassment gradually chips away at the enemy ADC's health, pressuring them to maintain distance from the wave.

- If the enemy ADC and support exhibit skill in dodging your spells and apply pressure to you and your support, don't panic. It's a manageable scenario. Karthus excels in playing defensively. If you're compelled to yield ground and farm under the safety of your tower, do so without hesitation. Keep in mind that Karthus will likely outscale most conventional ADCs. While gaining an early advantage is ideal, it doesn't always go as planned. Exercise patience until you reach level 6, monitor the map for potential kills or assists, and continue accumulating farm. Remember, you're playing for the long-term success of the game.


# 2) Mid and Late-Game Team Fights:


As the early game transitions into the mid game, Karthus begins to truly excel. Reaching level 11 provides a significant power spike thanks to your ultimate, and by this point, you should have secured at least one complete item, preferably Liandry's. Let's delve into how the mid game should be navigated:

- Now that you've acquired damage, your objective is to unleash it upon the enemy team. Keep in mind that your primary goal remains farming, but as a hyper-carry, you must participate in team fights, particularly those that hold strategic significance, such as contests for Baron or Dragon. It's crucial to understand that you shouldn't initiate fights. Patience is paramount. Strive to remain unnoticed by the enemy team, avoiding drawing their attention, and instead, fire off your skill shots comfortably from a safe distance while the enemy team focuses on your teammates. Once again, as a hyper-carry, your survival is of utmost importance. Even if your team engages and you can't immediately contribute damage, hang back and await the opportune moment.

- Knowing how and when to use your ultimate is crucial during this stage of the game. The tension over objective control escalates, and pivotal battles can decide the game's outcome. It's imperative to reserve your ultimate for critical situations. For instance, imagine your team is slightly behind in tempo, and the enemy team has initiated the Baron. Your team arrives, intent on contesting it. You can proactively launch your ultimate just before or at the onset of the fight to set the stage for your teammates, potentially disrupting the enemy's objective capture in the process.

- Late-game situations can be rather challenging. Your damage output is exceptionally high, but finding opportunities to apply it to the enemy team becomes increasingly difficult. Moreover, your opponents are scaling, and you remain vulnerable. They may employ items like Zhonya's and Banshee's to avoid your ultimates. It's a frustrating scenario where you must approach fights similarly to the mid game but with greater complexity, as the enemy team will go to great lengths to eliminate you, recognizing you as a potential win condition.
 
**Here's a recommended maneuver to turn the tide of a fight:** As the battle commences, close in and activate your (E), continuing to poke with your (Q). If the enemy team engages on you, promptly trigger Zhonya's while your (E) is still active. This grants valuable seconds for you and your team to orchestrate counterplays. Once Zhonya's concludes, resume poking with your (Q), and if the enemy manages to take you down, persist in using your abilities while your passive is active. At the last moment, unleash your ultimate, potentially finishing off any surviving foes. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but the damage you can deal if executed correctly should be more than sufficient for your team to gain the upper hand.



# 3) Itemization and Runes:


Let's keep everything simple:

- Runes: Opt for Dark Harvest, Cheap Shot, Eyeball Collection, and Ultimate Hunter in the primary tree. In the secondary tree, Precision runes are the way to go, specifically Presence of Mind and Last Stand.
- Summoner Spells: Stick with Flash and Exhaust for your summoner spells.
- Core Items: The widely popular build includes Liandry, Sorcerer's Shoes, Shadowflame, and then either Rabadon's Deathcap or Zhonya's Hourglass, with Void Staff as your final item.




**In conclusion:** 

Succeeding with Karthus as an ADC in League of Legends demands a profound grasp of positioning, laning strategies, and late-game tactics. With the correct approach, Karthus can evolve into a game-changing hyper-carry, surprising adversaries and reigning supreme on the rift due to his remarkable damage potential. Mastery of these advanced techniques will set you on the path to becoming a formidable Karthus ADC player. Best of luck on the Summoner's Rift!
