# Introduction

In the nuanced world of "League of Legends", wave management stands as a cornerstone of high-level play. It's the chess match within the wars of Runeterra, where minions are the pawns that can grant you dominion over your lane opponent. This article delves into one of the game's most strategic aspects—wave management—and explains how to use it to control the battlefield, starve your enemy, and ultimately, secure victory.

# Understanding the Basics

Minion waves are the lifeblood of the laning phase, consisting of melee, ranged, and periodically, cannon and super minions. By default, waves meet in the middle of the lane and clash with equal force, but a knowledgeable player can manipulate them to their advantage.

# What is Freezing?

Wave freezing is a technique used to keep the minion wave stationary on a specific part of the lane—preferably just outside your turret range. This tactic forces your opponent to overextend to farm, making them susceptible to ganks, and restricts their access to gold and experience.

# How to Freeze a Wave

To initiate a freeze, you'll want to maintain a delicate balance where the enemy wave slightly outnumbers yours. Here’s how:

1. Thin the Wave: Trim the enemy wave down so that there are only 3-4 extra minions than your wave.
2. Positioning: Stand just outside your turret range, intercepting the enemy minions.
3. Maintenance: Only last-hit minions and adjust your damage output to match the rate of incoming enemy minions.

# Advantages of Freezing

Freezing can zone opponents from crucial resources and open them up to ganks. By controlling the wave, you assert dominance in your lane, which can translate into a significant lead for your team.

# The Transition to a Slow Push

When you've had control of a freeze for a while, the dynamics of the minion waves can lead to an inevitable shift. Since your wave is closer to your side of the map, your minions arrive sooner, and even if you're only last-hitting, this slight numerical advantage will gradually lead to a build-up of minions. This involves allowing your wave to incrementally build up a larger force to overwhelm the enemy turret. 

# When and Why to Slow Push

* Objective Control: Have a slow push right before an objective spawns. This creates a dilemma for the enemy: contest the objective and lose the wave or clear the wave and concede the objective.
* Resource Denial: A well-timed slow push forces the enemy to choose between engaging with your team or losing a significant amount of gold and experience.
* Reset and Power Spike: By slow pushing, you can recall to purchase items and return to your lane without losing much—if any—farm, if your slowpush was big enough you might be able to “trap” the opponent in a lane where you have more health, mana and gold spent advantage. Thus enabling you for success.

# The bounce back!

No matter what, when you crash a decent wave under the enemy turret it’s very often going to bounce back, because his minions are going to start stacking up and push, you can now look out to freeze again!

# Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the key signs that indicate I should start freezing my lane?

The decision to freeze a lane can depend on various factors. Here are some key signs:

1. Vulnerability to Ganks: If you are susceptible to enemy jungler ganks, freezing near your turret makes you safer.
2. Denying Farm: When you're ahead of your opponent and want to deny them farm and experience safely.
3. Opponent Roaming: If your opponent is roaming, a freeze can force them to lose farm or return to lane, reducing their roaming impact.
4. No Objective to Take: If there are no immediate objectives (like Dragon, Rift Herald, or Towers) to contest, maintaining a freeze can be more beneficial than pushing.

### Are there any situations where I shouldn't attempt to freeze or slow push?

Yes, there are several scenarios where freezing or slow pushing might not be ideal:

1. Teamfighting Phase: If the game has progressed beyond laning phase and teams are grouping for fights or objectives.
2. Objective Control Needed: If an important objective is about to spawn, it's often better to push out your lane to have lane priority.
3. Your Team Needs You: If your presence is needed to contest objectives or support a team fight, freezing would be a mistake.
4. Opponent Impact: If your lane opponent can impact other areas of the map significantly more than you can from a freeze, it's often better to push and follow.

### What are the risks of freezing a lane, and how can I mitigate them?

The primary risks involve:

1. Global Pressure: You might give your opponent freedom to roam and exert pressure elsewhere.
2. Objective Loss: While freezing, you might concede objectives or fail to support your team in skirmishes around Dragon or Herald.
3. Jungle Pressure: Your opponent may call their jungler to break the freeze, potentially leading to a dive if you're low on health.

Mitigation strategies include:

* Warding: Keep river and jungle entrances warded to be aware of enemy movements.
* Health Management: Stay healthy enough to avoid being dived under your turret.
* Communication: Inform your team about the enemy laner roaming and your intention to freeze so they can play more cautiously.

### How do I decide between farming a big wave or joining a team fight that's about to start?

Deciding between farming a big wave or joining a team fight depends on several considerations:

1. Winning Condition: If your participation in the fight could sway the outcome significantly, then it's often worth leaving the wave.
2. Wave Value: If the wave is particularly large and you're at risk of losing a significant amount of gold and experience, you must weigh this against the potential gains of the team fight.
3. Champion Role: If you're playing a champion that excels in team fights or has crucial engage/disengage abilities, your team may need you.
4. Objective Aftermath: Consider what objectives can be taken after the team fight. If winning the fight could lead to Baron, Dragon, or towers, it might be more valuable than the wave.

Ultimately, communication with your team and quick assessment of the situation are crucial. If your team can avoid or delay the fight until you clear the wave, that would be ideal. If not, and your presence is necessary, it might be best to join the fight and try to capitalize on any objectives secured immediately afterward.

# Conclusion

Wave management is a skill refined over countless games, a subtle art that separates the good from the great. By practicing the techniques outlined above, you can gain an invaluable edge over your lane opponent, and by extension, control the flow of the game. Remember, in the rift, as in the ocean, those who master the tides command the battle. Thank you all for reading and good luck in the rift!
