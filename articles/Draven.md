# How to Counter Draven: Quick Guide

In this article, we're going to delve into the art of dealing with a Draven pick. For many of us ADC enthusiasts, it can be quite nerve-wracking when the enemy team locks in Draven during the champ select. However, today is the day we put an end to that fear!

Over the years, I've honed my skills and strategies to consistently come out on top in my lanes when facing Draven. I'm here to share some invaluable tips and tricks that will undoubtedly help you do the same.

## 1)   Laning Phase: Pressure and Submission 

Admit it, Draven boasts a formidable early-game advantage, largely thanks to the colossal damage output from his spinning axes. Matters can get even more challenging if he pairs up with an aggressive support like Thresh or Nautilus. In such cases, it's crucial to show respect.
You might find yourself unable to contest Draven's aggressive positioning and initiative as he takes control of the lane. In doing so, you might feel like you've given up control, but that's perfectly acceptable because it's often your best course of action. Now, it's time to shift your strategy from controlling to subtly influencing.

- Managing the Wave:

Allow the wave to crash under your tower and start a slow push towards the enemy side. The goal is to build up a substantial wave that discourages your opponents from engaging with you. If they choose to engage, it's a big risk since all your minions will target them, potentially tipping the fight in your favor without much effort.

Once the wave reaches and crashes under their tower, Draven will likely attempt to push it back towards you. This is because freezing the lane is challenging for him due to his champion's mechanics. During this phase, it's essential to respect his zone, avoid unnecessary trades, and let the wave once again accumulate under your tower before initiating another slow push.

- Trading Opportunities:

Recognizing the right moments to trade with Draven is crucial. During the early game, such opportunities can be relatively rare, especially if he doesn't make many mistakes. However, it's essential to ping your jungler and encourage them to play around your lane because Draven players tend to push excessively and overextend. This creates openings for potential 3v2 engagements, and it's in your team's best interest to exploit these opportunities.

Allowing Draven to farm freely and stack his passive is not in your team's favor. This champion has a remarkable ability to snowball rapidly, often out of nowhere. Therefore, you should consistently clear vision in your lane to create opportunities for your jungler to gank. This not only pressures Draven but also helps your team gain an advantage and control over the game.


## 2) Understanding Axe Mechanics:

Draven's damage largely depends on his ability to catch spinning axes. Understanding the mechanics behind his axes is crucial in neutralizing his threat. In this section, we'll dive into the intricacies of Draven's "Spinning Axe" ability.

- Predictable Axe Bounces: Game changer in fighting situations

When Draven activates his Q ability, "Spinning Axe," the axes will bounce off targets at a predictable angle. This mechanic provides you with an opportunity to manipulate his axe landing positions. Position yourself strategically to force Draven into uncomfortable positions when trying to retrieve his axes. For example, you can stand closer to terrain or within your minion wave to make it challenging for him to catch his axes without putting himself in danger.

- Disrupting Damage Output:

By consistently forcing Draven into suboptimal axe-catching positions, you can significantly disrupt his damage output. Draven's strength lies in his ability to maintain high DPS (damage per second) by juggling his axes effectively. Disrupting this rhythm can render him less effective during fights. Champions with the ability to displace him or create terrain obstacles can further exacerbate his struggles in managing his axes.

- Timing Abilities and Engagements:

To maximize your advantage against Draven, time your abilities and engagements carefully. Wait for him to commit to catching an axe before engaging or poking. This will force him to choose between catching the axe for damage or avoiding your abilities. Additionally, consider engaging when he's about to catch an axe that would put him in a vulnerable position. This can catch him off guard and make him pay for his predictability.

- Disallow his plays: 

In lower elo, a common issue arises during team fights: Draven is often forgotten. He goes unnoticed, and his plays are left unchecked. When the fight begins, he patiently waits to eliminate your squishiest champions. Draven should never be neglected, particularly in the late game when his shorter attack range hampers his damage output. With his limited mobility, any positioning error should prompt your team to engage. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain a constant focus on him throughout team fights, making him your top priority.


Incorporating these strategies into your gameplay will not only mitigate Draven's strengths but also give you a significant edge when facing this aggressive marksman in the bot lane.
