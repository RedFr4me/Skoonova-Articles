# Support Wave Control: Unleashing Your Hidden Potential

As a support, you might assume that wave control is not your primary responsibility, but that's where you'd be mistaken. While you won't be farming minions like your ADC, your actions in manipulating waves can significantly impact the outcome of the game. Let's delve into this essential aspect of support play, exploring how it can shift the tides in your favor.
- Level 2 Race: A Game-Changing Advantage

In the world of bot lane skirmishes, securing an early level 2 can be a game-changer, especially when you're running an aggressive composition. **However**, mindlessly auto-attacking minions won't guarantee this advantage. In fact, it can unintentionally push the wave toward the enemy turret, providing them with safety. To secure that all-important level 2 advantage, a more calculated approach is required. By judiciously auto-attacking minions, you can gain a slight XP edge. When the second wave arrives, you'll hit level 2 before your opponent, catching them off guard. The key here is not to telegraph your intentions to the enemy. If they sense your impending level 2 and retreat, don't force the issue; you've still exerted effective pressure.

#### Timing is Crucial: Pushing Under the Enemy Tower


There are occasions when pushing the wave under the enemy tower becomes imperative, whether for a recall, roam, or to contest an objective. If your ADC initiates the push, your role as a support is to assist while being mindful of timing. It's crucial not to let the next enemy wave arrive prematurely, forming a tempting target for the enemy ADC. If your ADC lacks the awareness to discern the right moment to push, you may find yourself taking on the role of advisor.

- The Art of Freezing: Controlling the Lane

Freezing the lane is a strategic move that supports can employ to great effect. For instance, when your ADC is absent, and the enemy wave is about to crash under your turret, you can take aggro, absorbing minion damage until your reinforcements arrive. This initiates a slow push in your direction, denying the enemy valuable CS.

In situations where you're running a pressure-heavy composition in the bot lane and you find yourselves ahead, consider instructing your ADC to initiate a freeze. With the wave parked close to your turret, your adversaries face a dilemma: risk moving closer to farm and risk engagement, or hang back and forfeit precious gold by avoiding combat.

**Effective wave management is a skill that extends across all lanes, and as a support, it's one you must embrace to ascend the ranks. By mastering the art of wave control, you'll bolster your strategic arsenal and contribute significantly to your team's chances of victory. Wave manipulation isn't just for the ADCs; it's a tool that can elevate your support game to new heights. So, set your sights on those waves and navigate your way to success in the bot lane!**


## 2) Roaming as a Support: Timing and Coordination
- Soraka's Surprise Roam: Turning the Tide

Picture this: You're in the shoes of Soraka, renowned for her unrivaled healing prowess. Your ADC is safely farming, and the enemy bot lane is playing defensively, hugging their turret like it's their favorite teddy bear. This scenario presents a golden opportunity – Soraka's unexpected roaming potential. You can venture toward the mid lane, arriving just in the nick of time as your mid-laner's opponent attempts to make a play. With your perfectly timed silence and a well-placed heal, you can swiftly shift the balance of power and secure a kill. All this while your ADC continues to farm safely beneath their tower.

**However**, it's crucial to understand that this daring maneuver hinges on clear communication and unwavering trust. You're essentially relying on your ADC to handle a 1v2 situation without crumbling, all the while focusing on farming and staying alive. If your ADC isn't up to the task, such a play could backfire, potentially leaving your lane partner demoralized and frustrated.

Another key point to consider is the **risk factor**, especially in higher ELOs. Seasoned junglers possess a deep understanding of game dynamics and boast eagle-eyed map awareness. Leaving your lane to roam mid, with your ADC left to fend for themselves, might signal the green light for the enemy team to execute a bot lane dive. To mitigate this risk, ensure you maintain clear vision of the enemy jungler's movements and employ effective warding strategies to provide your ADC with an escape route.

- Risk-Taking Coordination with Your Team:

Now, let's dive into the art of roaming when your ADC is out of harm's way. Imagine you're piloting Nautilus, and your trusty Samira ADC is safely recalling due to the enemy wave crashing under their tower. With a pocketful of gold that could tip the scales in her favor, you have a few strategic options at your disposal.

Firstly, you could choose to synchronize your recall with Samira's, maintaining a unified presence in the lane and reducing the chances of either of you being caught alone. Alternatively, if a trip to the Fountain isn't on your shopping list and you're sporting a healthy HP bar, consider the potential for a mid-lane roam. Samira will need some time to return to the lane, affording you the opportunity to make a quick detour mid and then double back to join Samira on her return.

However, it's important to note the cons of this strategy. Venturing mid can carry the risk of getting entangled in a skirmish where you might lose a significant chunk of your health or, in the worst-case scenario, meet your demise. This approach also leaves your ADC unsynchronized and exposed to a 1v2 situation.

These examples underscore that effective roaming is not simply about abandoning your ADC. It's about capitalizing on your champion's unique strengths and coordinating seamlessly with your team to execute well-timed and impactful roams. The key lies in balancing risk and reward while maintaining constant communication and vigilant map awareness.


## 3) Shotcalling and Objective Control: Leading Your Team to Triumph
In the intricate dance of League of Legends, the role of shotcaller often falls squarely on the shoulders of the support. This isn't merely by chance; it's a testament to the support's exceptional map awareness and ability to orchestrate the game's pivotal moments.

- Objective Control:

Effective shotcalling is your ticket to securing game-changing objectives. Imagine your team successfully secures the dragon – your next move should be as swift as it is calculated. Immediately, set your sights on the Baron pit, strategically placing vision to prepare for the impending objective. This proactive stance keeps your team ahead in the game.

Furthermore, when you sense the approach of a decisive clash over an objective like Baron, your role as a support becomes paramount. Picture this: you're denying the enemy vision, establishing crucial vision deep within enemy territory, and gathering intelligence on the enemy team's movements. But that's not all; your next move involves rallying your teammates with well-placed pings, signaling that they must converge on Baron.

- Quick Decision-Making:

In the heat of battle, split-second decisions can be the difference between victory and defeat. As the shotcaller, you need to make these calls with clarity and confidence. Whether it's determining when to contest a dragon or Baron, your assessment of the situation becomes the team's guiding light.

For instance, if you spot the enemy jungler on the top lane while the dragon looms on the horizon, don't hesitate to ping your team into action. It's a 4v5 situation, and the dragon should be yours for the taking. But remember, it's not all about your damage output on the objective. Even if you're sporting a tank support, and the enemy team begins their advance during an objective takedown, your role pivots to becoming a living wall of pressure. Your presence alone could force them to rethink their approach and respect your influence.


## 4) Adaptation: Tailoring Your Pick to the Situation
In the realm of high-stakes League of Legends, one skill that separates the best support players from the rest is adaptability. Being versatile means having a diverse pool of champions at your disposal, ready to be called upon to complement your team's picks and counter the enemy's composition.

- Matching Your Team:

Let's take a moment to appreciate a simple yet potent strategy. Imagine your team has opted for champions with lower health and range – the kind that prefers a cautious approach. In this scenario, you, as the support, can step up to the plate by selecting an engage melee tank. You become the front line, the one who initiates teamfights and absorbs the brunt of the enemy's focus. This not only grants your teammates the freedom to unleash their damage from a safe distance but also instills a sense of security within the team.

- Supporting the Engagers:

Conversely, when your squad consists of bruisers, tanks, or champions primed for aggressive engages, it's your cue to play the role of an enchanter. As they wade into the fray, your task is to heal and shield your comrades, ensuring they stay in the fight as long as possible. Your support becomes a lifeline, a guardian angel ensuring that your brawlers can brawl without fear.

### Going the Extra Mile:

For those who want to delve deeper into the art of champion selection, there's a whole world of match-up analysis awaiting exploration. This entails considering not only your ADC's pick but also dissecting the enemy bot lane composition. What synergizes best with your ADC's chosen champion? And how can you exploit the weaknesses in your opponents' composition? These questions delve into advanced territory and might just be the topic for our next article!
