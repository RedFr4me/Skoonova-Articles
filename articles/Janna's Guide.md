# You Should Start Playing Janna: Ultimate Guide. 

I always enjoyed playing Janna, it’s a champion that allows me to support my ADC to the maximum. She has some of the strongest peeling abilities in the game. The tornado combined with your ultimate pretty much means that no one can touch your teammates. Not to mention when the shield starts to scale and you watch your ADC’s damage go wild.

# 1) You think Janna is a boring champ to play? 

- Janna may seem like a mundane champion to those who haven't explored her full potential. Many players mistakenly view her as a passive support focused solely on shielding and healing. However, the reality is quite the opposite; when played with finesse, Janna can adopt an aggressive playstyle during the laning phase, and her impact can be utterly game-changing.

- Yes, Janna can adopt an aggressive playstyle, particularly during the early game. Your (W) and (Q) abilities provide the means to consistently poke the enemy ADC when they attempt to secure a last-hit on minions. Concerned about becoming the focus of enemy attention while engaging? Your (E) ability can shield you, and if you successfully land a knock-up and slow on the enemy, you'll gain an additional 15% bonus shield.

- When is the ideal time to engage in poking? The answer is simple: seize every available opportunity. If you find yourself facing an enemy ADC with limited range, like Samira or Nilah, you can exert harassment effortlessly, even with basic auto-attacks. This approach not only applies pressure but also establishes dominance in the lane.  


# 2) Mastering Janna's Peeling Abilities:

- Howling Gale (Q): Janna's tornado is a versatile tool that can be used both defensively and offensively. Timing is crucial here. As a novice Janna player, it's essential to envision how you intend to use your tornado ability before you commit to using it. For instance, if your goal is to disrupt a Zac's leap, mentally picture Zac leaping in towards your team or a specific target. Position yourself strategically near the target, preparing for this scenario.

- When it comes to poking the enemy in the lane, pay close attention to the enemy wave's positioning. Anticipate which minion the enemy is likely to target next. This foresight enables you to aim your tornado in the precise direction required to hit your opponent effectively.

# 3) Scaling with Janna: From Shield to Victory:

Janna's scaling is a crucial aspect of her gameplay, especially when it comes to her shield ability, "Eye of the Storm" (E). Understanding how her kit evolves as the game progresses is essential for maximizing her impact. Let’s do a quick theoretical recap. 

- Shield Scaling: Janna's E is a simple yet potent ability. It provides a shield that scales with her ability power (AP) and bonus attack damage (AD). As the game goes on, her shield becomes more robust, significantly boosting the survivability and damage output of her ADC. 

- Skill Leveling: When playing Janna, focus on leveling her E early to provide your ADC with a strong protective shield. As the game advances, prioritize her Q for increased crowd control and peel potential. Finally, max her W last as it primarily serves as a utility tool for mobility and chasing.

Ok now that we've explored these aspects, let's delve into the specific situations where all these elements reach their peak potential.

- During the middle and late stages of the game, Janna's true potential comes to the forefront, particularly when your team boasts formidable engage champions and tanks. In such scenarios, you can position yourself in the backline, staying close to your ADC, and offer remarkable peeling support, allowing them to dish out insane damage. Therefore, teaming up Janna with a hyper-carry ADC amplifies the full extent of her capabilities, creating a synergy that can be truly game-changing.

- Consider a scenario where you're supporting a Jinx, a champion known for her limited mobility. Janna's scaling becomes pivotal in such situations, capable of completely altering the course of a teamfight. As her shield becomes more potent, your Jinx's damage output and survivability see a significant boost. You possess the power to thwart any aggressive dive toward your ADC, and in the most dire circumstances, your ultimate can serve as a complete disengage tool, creating a safe path for your team. 


- Pay close attention to your itemization choices to optimize Janna's shielding and healing capabilities. Here's what you should consider:

1. Moonstone Renewer: This item significantly enhances your shield and healing abilities.
2. Redemption: It provides a 15% boost to shield power along with an active ability that can heal a targeted area, making it extremely useful during teamfights.
3. Ardent Censer: This item grants an 8% increase in shield power, further amplifying your supportive potential.


**That's how you transform into a shielding, healing, and peeling machine.** I've been playing Janna for approximately 8 years, and I have no intention of stopping. She has weathered virtually every patch in League of Legends, from when my obsession with the game began until now.

In conclusion, by mastering her unique kit and comprehending when and how to utilize her abilities, you can evolve into an invaluable asset for your team, securing victories in the perpetually competitive realm of League of Legends.
