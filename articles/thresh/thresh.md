# Mastering Thresh: The Laning Phase

Thresh, the Chain Warden, is a champion who has stolen the hearts of many League of Legends players. With his versatile skill set and the potential for game-changing plays, it's no wonder Thresh enthusiasts can't help but fall in love with this champion. As a tribute to Thresh, this article marks the beginning of a series that will delve into various aspects of mastering this complex champion. Today, our focus lies on the often-overlooked but crucial laning phase.

# 1) Thresh's Advanced Laning Phase Strategies:

The laning phase is the foundation upon which League of Legends matches are built. For Thresh players, this phase offers numerous opportunities to shine. We will explore advanced techniques that high-ELO Thresh players employ to exert pressure, control the minion wave, and execute strategic roams. These skills can turn the tide of a game, making you an invaluable asset to your team.

- Creating Pressure in Lane: The Art of Psychological Warfare

Creating pressure in the lane doesn't always require throwing hooks left and right. In fact, one of the most potent forms of pressure with Thresh is the threat of the hook itself. Position yourself aggressively, standing between the enemy ADC and their minions. This placement makes it challenging for them to farm without risking your potent crowd control abilities. Additionally, leverage your Flay (E) ability to zone enemies away from cannon minions - they're crucial for gold and experience. Here's a practical example:

Imagine you're in the bot lane, and the enemy ADC is attempting to farm under their tower. Position yourself in a manner that suggests a possible Flay into your tower. This creates uncertainty for the enemy ADC, forcing them to think twice before approaching for CS.

- The Mind Game: Holding onto Your Hook

One unconventional yet effective tactic is to hold onto your Death Sentence (Q). It may sound counterintuitive, especially to lower-ELO Thresh players, but the mere presence of an available hook can create immense pressure. Your enemies know you possess a potential game-changing ability, and they'll be on edge, never quite certain when you'll unleash it. This psychological warfare can lead to positioning mistakes from the enemy ADC. They'll become more hesitant, making farming increasingly difficult. The longer you withhold your hook, the more pressure you stack, increasing the likelihood of an enemy mistake that you can capitalize on. Don't forget to utilize bushes to apply even more pressure.

- Controlling the Minion Wave: Thresh's Wave Management

Wave control is an indispensable skill for high-ELO players, and Thresh is no exception. Utilize your Relic Shield charges judiciously to secure cannon minions for the bonus gold. Additionally, employ the bonus damage from your Flay to last-hit minions when necessary. Mastering wave control allows you to deny the enemy valuable resources while setting up gank opportunities for your jungler.

# 2) Executing Strategic Roams: Wandering from the Bot Lane

- Thresh's mobility through his Dark Passage (W) ability provides the opportunity for well-timed roams to other lanes. High-ELO players understand the importance of leaving their lane at precisely the right moments to impact other parts of the map. Coordinate with your team, particularly your jungler, to maximize the impact of your roams. Consider these scenarios:

- Push the wave and roam mid when your mid-laner has crowd control abilities, and the enemy mid-laner is overextended. Your presence can secure a kill and establish control over the mid-lane, which can lead to advantageous objective setups.


# 3) Predicting Enemy Movements: A Thresh's Sixth Sense

The ability to predict enemy movements is the hallmark of an exceptional Thresh player. Anticipate where your opponents are likely to go, rather than aiming for where they currently stand. It's about being in their head and thinking like they might think. This skill can be honed through practice and studying your opponents' behavior. Consider this example:

In a late-game teamfight, observe how the enemy carries tend to kite in a specific direction to maintain distance from your team. Predict this movement, aim your hooks strategically, and watch as they unwittingly walk into your grasp, allowing your team to secure a game-changing victory.

## **The Thresh Skin Mind Game: A Trick Up Your Sleeve**

For those who desire an extra layer of psychological warfare, consider using the Deep Terror Thresh skin. This skin allows you to bait opponents by starting the hook animation and canceling it immediately. It can be a subtle yet highly effective way to keep your adversaries constantly on edge.

Incorporating these advanced techniques into your Thresh gameplay will elevate your performance and make you a formidable presence on the Rift. Stay tuned for the next installment in our Thresh series, where we'll explore mid to late-game strategies that can help you dominate the late stages of the match. Thresh isn't just a champion; he's an art form, and we're here to help you master it.
