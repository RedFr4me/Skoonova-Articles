# Change Your Mindset: Elevate Your League of Legends Game

In the competitive world of League of Legends, where every match carries the weight of your progress, it's easy to get caught up in a whirlwind of frustration and self-doubt. Like many aspiring players, I was trapped in a cycle of stagnation, my rank oscillating between high gold and low platinum. I felt like I was playing at my best, but the results didn't reflect my efforts. Something was holding me back, and it wasn't my teammates, my luck, or even the champions I chose.

**It was my mindset.**

The journey to improvement began when coaches and friends pointed out a glaring issue â€“ I had become my own worst enemy. I was quick to point fingers, lay blame, and vent my frustrations at my teammates. Even worse, I found myself making excuses for my own mistakes and poor decision-making, as if admitting my flaws was a blow to my ego. In a bizarre twist of irony, I even berated my opponents when they outplayed me, as though their success was an affront to my pride. I was in full frustration mode, and it was clear that my mindset was a major roadblock to my progress.

## Improve Your Mind: Improve Your Life!

You might be wondering, "What does my mindset have to do with climbing the ladder?" Well, everything. League of Legends isn't just about mechanical skill or champion mastery; it's also a psychological battle. Let me tell you about my wake-up call.

- **1. Recognize Your Patterns**

The first step in improving your mindset is self-awareness. Recognize your patterns of behavior and thought. Are you quick to blame others when things go south? Do you find excuses for your own mistakes? Take a moment to reflect on your last few games and honestly assess your reactions.

Now, you have to learn how to stop doing that; it's a key factor. Just mute everybody if you can't stand the fact of someone blaming you. Don't take any seconds to flame people and use your brain in the most efficient way: adapt to the situation. You're playing jungle and the mid-laner got killed 2 times in 2 minutes. Alright, assess the situation; your mid-laner is now behind. Is he a win condition? In that situation, he's not, so let's play around the bot side. If he's a win condition, try to play around him for a bit so he gets back ahead. Assess what champions are going to scale anyway; if you have a Sion top, ganking might not be the most efficient way to use your precious time. Getting the bot lane ahead, securing drakes, and having mid-lane pressure will be the priority.

- **2. Cultivate a Growth Mindset**

A growth mindset is the key to success in League. Losses are inevitable, but understand that losses are opportunities to learn, not reasons to despair. Embrace challenges as chances to improve.

Here's what I started doing after a loss: I immediately go to the replay and see where I went wrong. Was there something I could have done to win that game? Is there a mistake I made that I can stop making? Were my decisions sharp enough?

You need to put yourself into a constant growth system, and it's only by making mistakes and identifying them that you're actually able to learn.

## Adapt Your Playstyle to Any Situation

Now, let's talk about adaptability. League of Legends is a game of constant change. No two matches are the same. Whether you're facing a different champion, a new meta, or a unique team composition, your ability to adapt is your secret weapon.

- **1. Learn Multiple Roles**

Being a one-trick pony can be limiting. Consider learning multiple roles and champions. This not only keeps the game fresh but also makes you more adaptable when your preferred role is taken or countered. For each role, try to learn different types of champions as well. Let's say you're playing mid-lane and your team has a lot of area of effect champs (AoE); you can then play an assassin or a hyper-carry bruiser. On the other hand, in the opposite situation, you should consider playing an (AoE) champ like Lissandra, for example, in order to balance your team's powers.

- **2. Study the Meta**

Stay up-to-date with the current meta. Knowing which champions are strong and which are weak can inform your picks and bans. It's like having a cheat sheet for champion selection. Stay informed on all the details of itemization as well.

- **3. Watch High-Elo Players**

Watching high-Elo players stream or reviewing their games can provide valuable insights. Pay attention to how they adapt to different situations, build paths, and adjust their playstyle.

## Going the extra mile: Get Advice from Professionals

Getting coaching can really change the way you approach and understand the game. It might also help you identify mistakes that you didn't even know about. Knowledge is the most powerful skill you can develop.

In conclusion, success in League of Legends isn't just about flashy plays and mechanics. It's about nurturing the right mindset and being adaptable. I can personally attest to how these changes transformed my gameplay and helped me climb from gold to platinum and beyond. So, fellow summoners, embrace the journey, learn from each game, and adapt to every situation. Change your mindset, and start that win streak today. You've got this!
