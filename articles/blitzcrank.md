# Early Game Guides: How to Counter Blitzcrank

When it comes to the early game and laning phase in League of Legends, few things strike fear into the hearts of bot lane players like Blitzcrank's menacing Rocket Grab. That deadly hook can turn a promising laning phase into a nightmare in an instant. However, fear not, for with the right strategies and knowledge, you can effectively counter Blitzcrank and come out on top. In this article, we will delve into three key aspects of countering Blitzcrank in the early game.

## 1) Positioning and Minion Wave Management:

As always, positioning is your first line of defense against Blitzcrank's hooks. Ensuring that you maintain a safe distance from him is paramount. Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab will prioritize the first target it hits, whether it's an enemy champion or a minion. Therefore, standing behind your minion wave can work wonders.

Minion wave management holds equal importance. When your wave is pushing toward Blitzcrank's side of the lane, you create a protective barrier that can intercept any hooks he attempts. However, it's crucial to exercise caution in this scenario. League of Legends revolves around balance, meaning that when you gain an advantage in one aspect, you may compromise in others:

- In this specific situation, you become more vulnerable since you have less distance to retreat.
- Furthermore, you should remain vigilant about Blitzcrank's various engagement tools. He can utilize his Flash (E) to close the gap and knock you up, catching you off guard. Alternatively, he might extend his Flash from a bush, taking you by surprise. He can even rapidly close the gap using his (W) - (E) combination, granting him extra movement speed while knocking you up."

Conversely, if your minion wave is closer to your tower, Blitzcrank must overextend to attempt a hook, increasing the risk for him. Communicate with your support to control the wave's positioning effectively.

## 2) Positioning Importance:

- The Triangular Formation 


The triangular formation is a strategic concept where you position yourself in a way that you don't directly confront the enemy's most dangerous champion. Additionally, it ensures that your teammate is within close proximity, allowing both of you to offer assistance effectively. Therefore, if Blitzcrank does succeed in hooking one of you, the other can promptly step in to provide immediate support.

- Rotation concept

Blitzcrank, like most supports, typically aims to target the ADC as their primary objective. Consequently, he will constantly attempt to position himself to face you directly. Your objective is to coordinate with your support to maintain a strategic rotation that prevents you from directly facing Blitzcrank. Instead, you should position yourselves diagonally relative to him, leveraging the protection of the minion wave to avoid his hooks.

In lower Elo tiers, if your opposing Blitzcrank doesn't grasp this concept, it falls upon you to position yourself correctly and refrain from rotating until he does so.


- Improve Dodging Skills

When facing champions with skillshots as potent as Blitzcrank's (Q), mastering the art of efficient dodging becomes a critical skill. Here are a few tricks that have greatly improved my dodging abilities:

1: Unpredictable Movement: Avoid falling into a pattern of predictable movement. Alternate your direction unpredictably to make it difficult for your opponent to anticipate your next move.

2: Timing Sidesteps: Learn the art of sidestepping correctly and at the right moment. Timing is crucial, as it can determine whether you successfully evade a skillshot.

3: Enemy Champion Animation: Pay close attention to the animation of the enemy champion. Oftentimes, their movements and cues can give away when they are about to unleash a skillshot.

4: 90-Degree Sidestep: When sidestepping, aim for a 90-degree angle change in your movement. This allows you to change direction rapidly and catch your opponent off guard.

If you feel the need to practice your dodging skills, I recommend playing games like "LoL Dodge Game." These can provide valuable practice and help you sharpen your reflexes.


## 3) Champion Selection and Runes:

Choosing the right champion and runes can significantly impact your ability to counter Blitzcrank. Opt for champions with dashes, blinks, or crowd control abilities that can make it challenging for Blitzcrank to land hooks on you. For example, Thresh, Alistar, Morgana or Ezreal can be excellent choices. Alistar can Headbutt him away in case of an engage, Morgana can use her Black Shield to block the hook and Ezreal can simply dodge using his dash (E).

Additionally, consider your rune choices carefully. Defensive runes from the Resolve or Inspiration trees can give you extra survivability in the laning phase. Aftershock, Bone Plating, and Second Wind from Resolve can help you withstand Blitzcrank's engages. Alternatively, Unflinching or Perfect Timing from Inspiration can provide the utility and protection needed to survive and turn the tide in your favor.

- Warding and Vision Control

Proper vision control can't be overstated when facing Blitzcrank. Ward key areas, such as the river and the brushes in the bot lane, to gain information on potential ganks and Blitzcrank's positioning. This foresight allows you to react effectively to his engages and avoid getting caught out of position.

Consider investing in Control Wards, a small price to pay for peace of mind. Place them strategically in the brush closest to the river or even in the river itself. This denies vision to the enemy team and makes it harder for Blitzcrank to find openings for his deadly hooks.

Lastly, be vigilant when Blitzcrank mysteriously disappears from the lane. If he roams to mid or another lane, communicate this information to your team immediately. Be ready to follow or ping for assistance to prevent him from making game-changing plays elsewhere on the map.

**In conclusion, mastering the art of countering Blitzcrank in the early game and laning phase requires a combination of smart positioning, champion selection, rune choices, and vision control. By following these strategies and adapting to the specific situation in your games, you can minimize Blitzcrank's impact and pave the way for a successful bot lane experience. Good luck on the Fields of Justice!**
