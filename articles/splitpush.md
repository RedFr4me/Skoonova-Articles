# Split Pushing Tips: When? Why? and How?

In the complex and ever-evolving landscape of League of Legends, split pushing stands as one of the most powerful strategies for securing victory. This article is dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of the split push, offering a comprehensive guide to those looking to dominate their solo lanes. We'll delve into understanding the split push concept, explore advanced strategies and tactics, and stress the importance of team communication and macro-level decision-making.

# Understanding the Split Push Concept

At its core, split pushing is a strategic maneuver that involves a player pushing a side lane, typically either top or bot, with the primary aim of creating pressure on the map. This pressure forces the enemy team to respond, diverting their attention from objectives or teamfights in other areas. The rest of the player's team, the four-man squad, can then take advantage of the situation by securing objectives, winning fights, or maintaining map control.

To master the art of split pushing, map awareness is paramount. When you push a side lane, you become isolated from your team. Consequently, it's crucial to monitor the minimap vigilantly. Keep a watchful eye on enemy movements, especially if they send multiple champions to thwart your split push. Communicate any valuable information to your team.

**Split Pushing Strategies and Tactics**

The Right Time to Split Push: Knowing when to split push is a delicate balance. Typically, you want to split push when:

- Your champion excels in dueling or 1v1 scenarios.
- The enemy team is engaged elsewhere, like contesting a dragon or defending a tower.
You have good vision control in the area you plan to split push.
- The minion waves are in a favorable position (more on this below).


# Champion Selection: Adapting your split push to the game

Some champions are more suited for split pushing than others. Consider champions with strong dueling potential, escape mechanisms, or the ability to take down towers quickly. Examples include Fiora, Tryndamere, or Camille.

Assessing the State of the Game: Adapt your split pushing strategy based on the game's context. If your team is behind, your split push can alleviate pressure on the map and buy time for a comeback. Conversely, if your team is ahead, your split push can further extend your advantage.

- Tactics and Techniques: Advanced split pushing tactics include:

- Slow Pushing: Manipulate minion waves to create a slow push, which builds up a large minion wave that crashes into the enemy tower. This forces an enemy response, creating map pressure.
Proxy Farming: Farming between enemy towers to draw attention, disrupt the enemy jungler, and buy time for your team.
Bait and Switch: Appear to be split pushing, drawing enemy attention, then quickly join your team for a teamfight.


# Team Communication and Macro Play

Successful split pushing relies heavily on communication with your team. Inform them of your intentions and ask them to exert pressure elsewhere on the map.

Creating Map Pressure: Coordinate with your team to create map pressure. As the enemy responds to your split push, your team can secure objectives or engage in advantageous fights.

Macro-Level Decision-Making: Macro-level decisions are critical in split pushing. Determine when to group with your team and when to continue pushing. If a teamfight is brewing near an important objective, your presence might be needed. However, if the enemy team is scattered or disorganized, pushing for inhibitors or even the Nexus might be the better choice.

**Conclusion**

Mastering the art of split pushing is a journey that requires a deep understanding of League of Legends' strategic intricacies. By comprehending the concept, employing advanced strategies and tactics, and fostering effective team communication and macro-level decision-making, you can become a formidable force in your solo lane and contribute significantly to your team's path to victory. Remember, the split push isn't just a strategy; it's an art form, and you are its artist.
